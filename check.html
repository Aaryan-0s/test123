        This method attempts to emulate the “position: sticky” method. The element
         is set to ‘fixed’ or ‘relative’ depending upon whether the user has scrolled past the element.
        The element to be stuck is first identified and its current position on the page is calculated. 
     This is done by adding the position of
       the element relative to the viewport with the current scroll position.
